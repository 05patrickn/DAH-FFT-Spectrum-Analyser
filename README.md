# DAH-FFT-Spectrum-Analyser
All data processing and calibration files were made individually. The only shared files with my lab partner Eusebio Martin were the Real Time Analyser files, the .xlsx and all result .txt files.
Please note that the file directories might need to be amended to your laptop to run correctly. The C++ file for the Arduino UNO was taken from Benjamin Wynne, course organiser of DAH.
