# DAH-FFT-Spectrum-Analyser
All data processing and calibration files were made individually. The only shared files with my lab partner Eusebio Martin were the data_capture.py file and all result .txt files.
Please note that the file directories might need to be ammended to your laptop to run correctly. The C++ file for using the Arduino UNO was taken from Benjamin Wynne, course organiser of DAH.
